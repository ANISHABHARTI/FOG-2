Rain Pattern Grid - Dynamic Rainfall Animation 🌧️
Welcome to the Rain Pattern Grid project! This is a fun, dynamic rainfall animation displayed on a 15x20 grid. Each square randomly generates falling drops with different colors, and the effect runs smoothly in real-time. What's even cooler? The grid size is completely adjustable, and it has a playful, game-like feel!

Feel free to explore the rain effect, tweak the settings, and enjoy the visual experience.
